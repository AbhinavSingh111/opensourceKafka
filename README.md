## Architecture

This app focuses on scalable, flexible and reactive app architecure. Parts of the architecture are inspired by [DatMusic](https://github.com/alashow/datmusic-android).

It is a version of MVVM with interactors as an additional layer to enhance re-usability. The app uses following frameworks


* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) (for thread switching; and streams with Flow)
* [Jetpack compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) 
the app is built completely with Jetpack compose and all the latest APIs.
* [Livedata](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)
* Retrofit2
* [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)
* [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer) - For audio playback
